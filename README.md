Book My Show API-SpringBoot_BackEnd

1.Project Overview:
    * Developed a comprehensive Spring Boot backend for a ticket booking system, inspired by "BookMyShow."
    * Designed and implemented a set of RESTful APIs enabling users to interact with the ticket booking         system seamlessly.

2.Functionalities Implemented:
    * Created functionalities to add movies and theaters dynamically into the system.
    * Implemented features to fetch total revenue of theaters and recommend popular movies based on user        interactions.
    * Enabled the creation of shows for any movie in any theater and facilitated seat bookings for these        shows.
    * Provided detailed information about shows, available seats, and show timings to users.

3.User Experience Enhancements:
    * Incorporated email notification services to keep users informed about successful bookings and             important updates.
    * Designed a user-friendly interface for browsing available movies, selecting shows, and reserving          tickets.

4.Technical Stack:
    * Leveraged Java for backend development, utilizing Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA (Hibernate) for         efficient API creation and database interactions.
    * Utilized MySQL for database management and Maven for dependency management and project building.

5.Key Responsibilities:
    * Designed and implemented entity relationships and database schemas using JPA annotations.
    * Created repositories for data access, implemented business logic in services, and developed RESTful       API endpoints in controllers.
    * Configured database connections, security settings, and integrated email notification services for        user engagement.

6.Achievements:
    * Successfully developed a scalable backend system allowing users to seamlessly book tickets for            various shows and manage their bookings.
    * Ensured high data integrity and responsiveness in handling concurrent user interactions.

7.Challenges Overcome:
    * Managed complexities in handling seat availability, show timings, and user bookings while                 maintaining system integrity.
